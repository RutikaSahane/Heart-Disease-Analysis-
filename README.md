# Heart-Disease-Analysis-

OVERVIEW:- 

This document provides a step-by-step guide to performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset. The objective is to analyze and understand patterns in the data to find factors contributing to heart disease risk, which can then be used to build predictive models or derive insights.

WORKFLOW:-

1)Data Loading and Preprocessing
Load the dataset and inspect the structure, types, and completeness of data.
Handle any missing values or data type inconsistencies.
Clean data by removing or imputing any anomalies.

2)Data Exploration and Visualization
Univariate Analysis: Analyze each variable individually to understand its distribution.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between the features and with the target variable.
Correlation Analysis: Calculate and visualize correlations between features. 

3)Feature Engineering (Optional)
Create new features that might enhance insights, such as age groups or risk score categories.

4)Insights and Hypothesis Formation
Identify variables that show a strong relationship with heart disease.
Hypothesize potential risk factors for heart disease.

CONCLUSION:-

After performing EDA, you should be able to identify patterns and gain insights into the factors associated with heart disease. Here are some possible conclusions:

Age and Gender: Older age and male gender might show higher rates of heart disease.

Cholesterol and Blood Pressure: Higher cholesterol and blood pressure levels could be correlated with a higher risk.
  
     These findings lay the groundwork for further predictive analysis and model building to detect heart disease risk.
